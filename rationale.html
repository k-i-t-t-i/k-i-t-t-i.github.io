	<p class="demopara" style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:10%;">This website directly relates to material we have covered in class about the Africa unit, and also demonstrates the essential question I have chosen, which is, “What are the dangers of a single story? ” As a whole, this project gathers multiple examples of single stories from different sources. It includes a summary of each source along with my own perspective, with the addition of MEAL paragraphs. It shows that I have analyzed each source and summarized what I have gathered from it. I have also split up each source into its own page, showing that each source is different and has its own way of demonstrating the essential question. The first source, the TED Talk, directly relates to my thesis. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is aware of what single stories are, and gives multiple examples of them. She also explains how damaging they are to people who are unaware. My second source, “Binta and the Great Idea,” indirectly displays an example of a single story through Binta’s father’s friend. I explain how it exhibits a single story, and also why it is damaging. For my last source, “The Africa You Don’t Know,” it talks about single stories without being fully aware it is doing so. It mainly consists of facts and studies, and also accounts from Africans who know the truth. All three of these sources clearly address the essential question, but I further explain how they do so. In addition to the writing, I have included pictures related to each source. All in all, I believe this project focuses on the essential question and relates to the material we’ve covered, and I also think it shows that I have paid much attention and have created my own opinions on it.</p>
