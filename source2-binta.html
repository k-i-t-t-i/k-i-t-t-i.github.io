	<h3 style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:10%;">Summary</h3>
	<p class="demopara" style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:10%;">In Binta and the Great Idea, we're shown how some people in Africa view white people. Since they
	may perhaps lack the technology, they may be unaware of how Europeans have treated them for hundreds of years. They've been ensalved, stolen
	from, and abused out of greed and malevolence. For some reason though, Binta's father's friend thinks very highly of what he calls "tubabs,"
	their word for white people. He marvels over things they have invented, such as wrist watches and fishing equipment. If he really has no clue
	about the history of Europe and Africa, this could potentially be harmful. Being grateful for European inventions is one thing, but putting
	white people on a pedestal is another.</p>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:10%;">Rationale</h3>
	<p class="demopara" style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:10%;">Binta and the Great Idea portrays the danger of a single story through Binta’s father’s friend. 
	The friend constantly praises tubabs for all these amazing things they’ve invented and impressive things they’ve done. 
	He marvels at the invention of the wrist watch, and is mesmerized at how it beeps when it strikes noon. He speaks highly of how advanced the 
	tubab’s fishing equipment is, and how advanced France’s weapons are. While this all may be true, the tubabs have done very horrible things to 
	the continent of Africa in the past. This really shows us what exactly he’s being told about white people. He thinks they’re amazing and 
	advanced, but he likely doesn’t know about the things Europeans did whilst Imperializing Africa. If he did know, he probably wouldn’t regard 
	them so highly. This is a major example of a single story portrayed through Binta and the Great Idea.</p>
